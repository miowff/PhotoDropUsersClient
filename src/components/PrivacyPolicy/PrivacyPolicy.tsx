                  Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use the
                  Service and we do not intentionally collect or maintain
                  Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old.
                  Protecting the privacy of children is very important to us.
                  Thus, if we obtain actual knowledge that a user is under 13,
                  we will take steps to remove that user’s Personal Information
                  from our databases. We recommend that children between the
                  ages of 13 and 18 obtain their parent’s permission before
                  submitting information over the internet. By using the
                  Service, you are representing that you are at least 18 years
                  old, or that you are at least 13 years old and have your
                  parents’ permission to use the Service.
